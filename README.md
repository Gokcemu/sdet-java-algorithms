# SDET Practice â€“ Java Algorithm Collection

This repository contains Java-based algorithm solutions to support continuous improvement in Java programming. The project is designed to strengthen core development skills, particularly from a Quality Assurance and SDET perspective.

## Project Structure

The code is organized into three difficulty levels:

- easy: Includes basic problems focused on loops, conditions, and simple data manipulation
- intermediate: Covers problems involving sets, maps, string logic, and frequency analysis
- challenging: Reserved for advanced problems that require deeper algorithmic thinking

## Technologies

Language: Java  
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA  
JDK: Java 17+

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills and boost Java fluency for technical roles, particularly in automation and SDET positions.

## Next Steps

- Continuously add new algorithms across all levels, with special focus on the challenging section
- Implement unit testing for both existing and upcoming solutions
- Refactor selected solutions using Java Streams or other optimized approaches
